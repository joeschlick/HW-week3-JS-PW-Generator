# Password-Generator
This file contains the code for a random password generator browser application.

It consists of 4 files - index.html, style.css, script.js, and README. All files (except README were provided in advance, and I only added code to the script.js file.

The application consists of a form called "Password Generator" with a field for the generated password and a genrate password button.

When the button is clicked the user is prompted to enter the length of the password and what kind of charaters they want to be included.  User gets confrimation alerts for each selection they make.

Once selections are made, a random password based on user selections is returned.
